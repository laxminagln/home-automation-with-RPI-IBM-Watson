The Raspbian OS (Stretch release), which is the operating system that runs on your Raspberry Pi 3.
Various utilities to work with the Pi, and the RF receiver and transmitter modules: Wiring Pi, which 
is an open source library that is used to access the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi rc-switch, which 
is a low-level C++ library for controlling 433-MHz hardware that runs on various platforms, including 
the Raspberry Pi 433Utils, which uses rc-switch and wiringPi to communicate with the RF receiver and 
transmitter
The home-automation project, which is the high-level code that runs the home automation platform itself. 
You will write much of this code yourself in Part 2, but don’t worry, I’ve provided a complete solution 
in GitHub if you get stuck (or just feel like skipping ahead).
Android Studio. While you can download the home automation app from the Google Playstore, you can also 
download the source for it from GitHub, and load it up in Android Studio. Or, if you don’t have an And-
-roid device, you can run the app code in the Android emulator. Either way, I’ll introduce you to the 
source code, and Android Studio is the IDE that you’ll use.
